## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted teal (#63B5A2) to suggest stability and trustworthiness in the migration process. Teal avoids the cliche of 'corporate blue' while remaining serious.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F3), almost the same hue as the primary color, desaturated for a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A gentle blue (#75A3B7) shifts the color temperature subtly, enhancing visual interest without overwhelming the interface; especially for interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, providing a balance of modernism and readability. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Consistent use of flat, modern icons that match the color palette.
- Clean and structured layout with a focus on data visualization and ease of navigation.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience.
